# UK Inflation Impact Analysis - PowerBI Project

# Overview
The UK Inflation Impact Analysis Project is an in-depth study on the effects of inflation on various sectors of the UK economy and its recent consequences on people's lives. The purpose of this project is to gain insights into inflation trends, understand the primary factors driving these trends, and comprehend the impact of ongoing inflation strikes on the UK's economy.

# Methodology
In this project, data was acquired from various sources, cleaned and structured using Microsoft Excel and Python's Pandas library. Relationships were established and the data was further restructured using Power Query.
